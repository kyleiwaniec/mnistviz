## Install and Running
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.

## Development

I recommend using nuclide: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide. It provides autocompletion, real
syntax checking and more.

After installing nuclide you need to run this

1. npm install --save-dev flow-bin
